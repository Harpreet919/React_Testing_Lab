# React Testing Lab (Fixed Starter)

## Quick Start
1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run: `npm install`
3. Run tests: `npm test`  (or `npm run test:coverage`)

## Files included
- babel.config.js
- jest.config.js
- src/Hello.jsx
- src/Hello.test.jsx
- src/setupTests.js
- src/testStyleStub.js
- src/testFileStub.js
- .github/workflows/tests.yml (uses `npm install`, no lockfile required)

## Notes
- package.json is pre-filled. Do **not** set `"type": "module"`.
- If your folder path contains spaces, it's fine. Just ensure you're in this folder before running npm commands.
